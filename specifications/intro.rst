Introduction
============

BrewBox tries to answer the question **of monitoring and controling** a micro brewery which comes to the brewer's wishing for :

* being able to ensure a constant quality of the beer produced.
* improving brew process efficiency as quantities produced increase.

Monitoring enables following the brewing process characteristics like mashing temperatre or boiling time. This is usually achived by fitting the micro brewery with sensors, like temperature probes.

Controling means acting on equipments fitted in the brewery to run the brewing steps like powering heating element to boil the mash or pumps for transferring liquids between kettles. Controling also requires components and knowledges to build control panel with displays, switches or PID controller.

Finally automation matches together monitoring and controling and enables automatic actuators control based on sensors data and programmable actions. It usually requires professional equipments like programmable logic controller and good knowledge in electronic and electricity.

The goal of BrewBox is to help home brewers to achieve these three goals by providing a system :

* flexible enough to fit any configuration of brewery with a wide range of sensors type.
* offering a large set of features for monitoring, controling and automate the brewery activity.
